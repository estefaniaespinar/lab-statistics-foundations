One player rolls two dices. Describe the measurable space and the random variable for:

A. The values that the player obtains.
B. The sum of the values obtained.
C. The maximum value obtained after rolling both dices.
Describe the following events:

A. The player obtains a number from 1 to 6 in the first die and a number between 1 and 6 in the second one.

# Challenge 3
Two players roll a dice. Describe the measurable space and the random variable for:

A. The score of player A.
B. The greatest score.
C. The earnings of player A if the game rules state that:
"The player with the greatest score gets a coin from the other player.".
D. The earnings of player A if the game rules state that:
"The player with the greatest score gets as many coins as the difference between the score of player A and player B.".
Describe the following events:

Case A: The score of player A is 2.
Case B: The greatest score is lower or equal than 2.
Case C: Considering the case where the winner gets as many coins as the difference between scores (D), describe:
Player A wins at least 4 coins.
Player A loses more than 2 coins.
Player A neither wins nor loses coins.

CASE A:
